# Hotel landing page

This is the first time I've done `figma to code` without looking at any youtube tutorials. When I looked at the design before I started, I thought it was very easy. When I started coding, I realized that it was not easy. (of course I got over it and finished this task flawlessly). I think I learned the subtleties of responsive design.

# What i learned

- How to do responsive design with Tailwind (mobile and desktop)
- Figma to Code
- customized scrollbar with [tailwind-scrollbar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tailwind-scrollbar)
